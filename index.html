<div class="article">
<p> Jury duty, amirite? It’s one of those parts of American-civic life that people either love to complain about, or conversely, for those who grew up on Law & Order reruns, are completely obsessed with. </p>

<p> First, some numbers just to get a sense of how pervasive the jury system is. In a year, according to the Center for Jury Studies, there are approximately 154,000 jury trials nationwide. The vast majority of these, some 149,000, are held in state courts, while 5,000 are tried in the federal court system. For all these trials, approximately 32 million Americans will be issued a jury summons each year. </p>

<p>Those are immense numbers considering the national image we have of juries -12 men and women, in a box – listening to Jack McCoy passionately argue the facts. And yet they are consistent. I consulted Paula Hannaford of the National Center for State Courts, who told me that the numbers do not change "unless the court implements major changes to its summoning and qualification procedures."</p>

<p>Numbers are reported on an individual state basis because each state court system has its own particular rules for jury selection, and use of jury trials. </p>

<p>I started with a look, in the most basic terms, at which states have the most jury trials.</p>

<p>California is the clear leader in number jury trials. This was unsurprising to me, because California, which had over 16,000 jury trials in 2007, the last year when a by the states survey of jury statistics was available, also had 36 million people. Vermont and Wyoming, which each had only 126 jury trials in 2007, had only around 16% of the population, at 623,481, and 534,876 respectively. </p>

<p>Would this trend of more people equals more jury trials hold up when adjusted for population? I divided the number of jury trials into the state population for the year the data was gathered to achieve a weighted ratio. I sourced the population data from Google trends data and confirmed it with various websites listing US Census Data. </p>

<p> When adjusted for population, a new set of outliers appeared.</p>

<p>Alaska and Alabama stand out as the states with relative highest number of jury trials when population is weighted. Alaska had 1111 jury trials for its 680,300 people; Alabama had 7587 jury trials for its 4,673,000 people.</p>

<p>Why? Looking at what states will pay jurors who are not otherwise compensated by their employers, Alabama’s pay rate was modest compared to other states at $10 or first day jurors, while Alaska’s was only slightly higher than the national average at $25 respectively.</p>

<p>I also looked at the relative number of jurors summoned who were then deemed to be qualified and available. From each state, I took the estimated number of juror summons sent out each year, and then used the percentage of jurors from these summons who were then determined “qualified and available,” to determine a real number. I weighted this number for population using the same numbers as above, to see if one state had a significantly higher number of jurors deemed qualified and available. Alaska popped up.</p>

<p>Does Alaska have more jury trials because the system works? I’m not sure this is statistically significant enough to mean much, but I plan to look further into laws or rules in Alaska that would encourage jury trials and juror participation.</p>

<p>As for Alabama’s fascination with jury trials? Still unsolved.<p>

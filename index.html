 <h1> Why Does Alabama Have More Jury Trials Than Everyone Else? </h1>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p> Jury duty, amirite? It’s one of those parts of American-civic life that people either love to complain about, or conversely, for those who grew up on Law & Order reruns, are completely obsessed with. </p>

<p> First, some numbers just to get a sense of how expansive the jury system is. In a year, according to the Center for Jury Studies, there are approximately 154,000 jury trials nationwide. The vast majority of these, some 149,000, are held in state courts, while 5,000 are tried in the federal court system. For all these trials, approximately 32 million Americans will be issued a jury summons each year. </p>

<p>Those are immense numbers considering the national image we have of juries - 12 men and women, in a box – listening to Jack McCoy passionately argue the facts. And yet they are consistent. I consulted Paula Hannaford of the National Center for State Courts, who told me that the numbers do not change "unless the court implements major changes to its summoning and qualification procedures."</p>

<p>These numbers, both of jury trials and number of potential jurors summoned, are reported on an individual state basis because each state court system has its own particular rules for jury selection, and use of jury trials. </p>

<p>I started with a look, in the most basic terms, at which states have the most jury trials.</p>

<p>California is the clear leader in number jury trials. This was unsurprising to me, because California, which had over 16,000 jury trials in 2007, the last year when a by the states survey of jury statistics was available, also had 36 million people. Vermont and Wyoming, which each had only 126 jury trials in 2007, had only around 16% of that population, at 623,481, and 534,876 respectively. </p>

<p>Would this trend of more people equals more jury trials hold up when adjusted for population? I divided the number of jury trials into the state population for the year the data was gathered to achieve a weighted ratio. I sourced the population data from Google trends data and confirmed it with various websites listing US Census Data. </p>

<p> When adjusted for population, a new set of outliers appeared.</p>

<p>Alaska and Alabama stand out as the states with relative highest number of jury trials when population is weighted. Alaska had 1,111 jury trials for its 680,300 people; Alabama had 7,587 jury trials for its 4,673,000 people.</p>

<p>Why? Each state is required to pay jurors some sum, however nominal, for their work, or as compensation for time missed from work. Do these states pay either disproportionately more, or less than than other states, making having a jury trials seem like a relative bargain? I looked into the question of juror pay. Looking at what states will pay jurors who are not otherwise compensated by their employers, as many salaried workers are, Alabama’s pay rate was quite modest compared to other states at $10 for first day jurors, while Alaska’s was only slightly higher than the national average at $25 per day.</p>

<p>I also looked at the relative number of jurors summoned who were then deemed to be qualified and available. From each state, I took the estimated number of juror summons sent out each year, and then used the percentage of jurors from these summons who were then determined to be “qualified and available,” to determine a real number. Because most states require summoned jurors to fill in a questionaire or to call in to determine who will be attending, I decided that those deemed "qualified and available" to be those who had shown intent to participate in the jury system on the day they were called. I weighted this number for population using the same numbers as above, to see if one state had a significantly higher number of jurors deemed qualified and available. Alaska popped up.</p>

<p>Does Alaska have more jury trials because the system works? I’m not sure this is statistically significant enough to mean much, as Alaska, with its small population of transient workers, often means the state is an outlier compared to other more static or larger states. </p>

<p>As for Alabama’s fascination with jury trials, further research revealed some interesting takeaways. Alabama has a rather turbulent history with respect to the jury trial that is at times as odds with this proportionately heavy reliance on the system.</p>

<p>In 2002 for example, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, known for his controversial fights to post the 10 Commandments on state property, <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/04/30/alabama-no-juries.htm">declared a suspension of juror trials</a> due to their cost to the state. In 2007, according to the Alabama Unified Court System's Annual Report and Statistics, the average cost to the state per jury trial in Alabama was $1,077, a 28% increase over the previous year, due likely to the inclusion of a one-time mileage paid to each juror which had not been offered to previous jurors, or not included in the final tally of costs. This number has continued to increase slightly each year, though changes to the overall amount paid by the state to conduct jury trials has remained relatively constant since 2007 at roughly 1.6 million annually. While Moore's suspension of jury trials was quickly lifted, it speaks to the relative expense attributed to the trials. </p>

<p>Likewise, Alabama has come under scrutiny for its allowance of judicial override in jury decisions in capital murder cases. In one of the more famous cases where this override has occured, Jackson vs. The State of Alabama, which was covered by The New Yorker article <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/17/double-jeopardy-3">Double Jeopardy</a>, a jury unanimously refused to send Shonelle Jackson to the electric chair in 1998 after having found him guilty of murder. After a separate case with an identical situation of judicial override made it to the United States Supreme Court, US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor declared "In capital cases the Court “trusts the judge” to level the correct punishment," thus allowing the practice to stand. According to this article, "nearly seventy Alabama judges have single-handedly ordered an inmate’s execution, and collectively they have done so more than a hundred times. Thirty-six of the nearly two hundred convicts on death row are there because of override." Despite this controversial concept of judicial override, which, while allowed by the US Supreme Court, remains very rare in the US (only Florida has a similar provision) Alabama continues to mount a statistically higher number of jury trials.</p>

<p>Lastly, and most paradoxically, Alabamans don't seem very impressed with their ability to get their jurors to show up. According to a <a href="http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/02/large_majority_of_madison_coun.html">2013 article</a>, Madison County Alabama has, according to its own data, only approximately a 33% attendance rate. While this checks against the statewide reported total of 34% reported qualified and available, as well as that of other cities, (I was cited anecdotally 35% as New York City's unofficial attendance average) it's interesting to note that this is considered poor turnout in state.</p>

<p>So why do Alabamans have more jury trials? While I wait for official comment from Alabama's Office of Court Administration, one line from the 2013 article may hold a clue. Says Presiding Circuit Judge Karen Hall, "the fact that a jury is about to be seated often has the effect of leading to the settlement of cases. So even though the jury pool often doesn't see a lot of action, they are moving things forward." All this to say, the juries may be called because of our public image of them. The idea of those 12 men and women in a box may just be the thing that keeps the system moving.</p>
